Costs related to the project are limited to 76 MXW Transformation Program funded organic and contractor labor. The decision to propose this approach was based on three overarching requirements:1. Continued use of the existing Air Force and DoD legacy systemss data and specific guidance in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) that this lean/cellular transformation was not to be achieved by lean process and plant for redesign, and not by an enterprise IT transformation.2. Integration of legacy systems information with new information collected in the redesigned cells, and necessary for the redesigned repair process, as defined in the redesign requirements based on analyses performed during the Fly-Off (2 Aug 04 - 2 Feb 05).3. Ability for the redesigned business units to flex and adapt as the underlying Air Force and DoD transformation efforts modify and overhaul the legacy systems environment. The core abilities to integrate data from disparate sources and to present performance information to the user remain constant regardless of the specific data sources.This systems does meet the criteria of Internal Use Software (IUS) reporting and has entered data into the AFEMS/AIM",AcquisitionSystem

Buyers of AWCF PWDs and their support personnel are required to input PASS transactions to document their actions during the pre-solicitation, solicitation, and award stages of the acquisition cycle. TACOM ILSC managers are interested in the length of time the procurement cycle takes--from Procurement Work Directive (PWD) generation to contract award. Standards have been developed to measure Administrative Leadtime (ALT) which is the length of the entire procurement process and Procurement Administrative Leadtime (PALT) which is the length of time the buyer takes to make the award. The TACOM PASS (Procurement Aging and Staging systems) was developed to track the status of Army Working Capital Fund (AWCF) Procurment Work Directives (PWDs) and provide management reports. Managers use the reports to track how well TACOM is doing meeting our ALT/PALT standards. Command ALT performance is an important element of yearly budget submissions and the accuracy of stock forecasts. Buyers and their support personnel are required to input PASS transactions to document their actions during the pre-solicitation, solicitation, and award phases of the acquisition cycle. EPIC (Electronic Procurement Information Console) database was developed to allow this input. EPIC allows buyers to retrieve contract information from the database through the use of queries. EPIC allows buyers to retrieve contract information by changing Procurement Method Codes and Available Procurement Points. Removal of EPIC will result in managers not able to track contract progression continuously resulting in a lag in contract performance.",AcquisitionSystem

This application links to both the PADDS (Procurement Automated Data and Document systems) database from Huntsville and ALTESS to record the initial issue and utilization of Requirements contracts at Warren and Rock Island. The principle purpose of this application is to look at the utilization rates and to predict when the contract will be exhausted based on either quantity or funds and to provide notifications to Buyers and Item Managers in sufficient time to take action. As LTCs (Long Term Contracts) become more prevalent, this application will become increasingly vital to the Organization. The LTC (Long Term Contracts) tracking application was designed to monitor usage on all Long Term Contracts (LTCs) (both IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) and Requirements) at all 3 commands to improve the visibility of usage on these contracts and provide Buyers and Item Managers sufficient notice to take action prior to the contract either expiring or being exhausted. The application also serves as a means of communication between Buyers and Item Managers where all appropriate information for ordering against a contract is readily available. When either a new contract or a new delivery order is found in PADDS (Procurement Automated Data and Document systems), the application creates the database records for the contract. ALTESS data is then added to record the arrival of the items into the depots. Although as much information as possible is captured from PADDS (Procurement Automated Data and Document systems) some of the critical contract information is contained in narrative fields and isn't available for the application to use. Consequently the Buyer/PCO (Procuring Contract Officer) is requested to provide additional information for the application to work correctly. At a minimum this would be the max qty available for each item for IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts or the J&A (Justification and Approval) dollars approved for Requirements Contracts. The ILSC (Integrated Logistics Support Center) item managers use this to track their long term contracts. It is unique because the item managers have visibility of LTC (Long Term Contracts) when in the past they had to rely on contacting Procurement.
